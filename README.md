## Project Overview

**Simon Game** is a browser-based memory challenge demonstrating **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **game logic** using **JavaScript and jQuery**. It highlights interactivity, user engagement, and pattern recognition in a clean, minimal interface.

This project demonstrates:

- Generating random sequences for the player to follow
- Tracking user input and validating correctness
- Visual and audio feedback on button presses
- Keyboard and mouse interaction handling
- Structuring a small front-end game with modular, maintainable code

## How to Play

1. Press **any key** to start the game.
2. Watch the sequence of colors light up.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
4. The sequence gets longer each round—see how far you can go!
5. Game ends when a wrong button is pressed.
6. Reach level 5 to win the game.
